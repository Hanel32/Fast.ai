# Fast.ai
Code repository for my adventures in the Fast.ai; application of neural networks in Python.

While the links below are also retrievable from the Fast.ai course itself, I'm keeping a list of the ones that I personally have reviewed during the learning process.

Lesson one helpful links:
- CNN Wikipedia: 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network
  - A bit of a cliche, the journey starts with getting your feet wet with the basal definition of what a convolutional neural network is.
  
- Explanation of image kernel: 
  - http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/
  - A cool little introduction to what exactly is going on behind the scenes with convolutions; how the filtering process works, and how    different features are extracted from an image.
  
- Neural Net Universality Theorem: 
  - http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html
  - An easily digestible proof that neural networks have the ability to approximate any function.
  
- Linear Algebra for CNN Cheatsheet: 
  - https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-algebra-cheat-sheet-for-deep-learning-cd67aba4526c
  - A quick look at what linear algebra concepts are necessary for neural networks, and numpy applications.
  
- CNNs from different viewpoints: 
  - https://medium.com/impactai/cnns-from-different-viewpoints-fab7f52d159c
  - A sensible explanation for what is actually happening when you parse a dataset of images with a CNN.
