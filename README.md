# Fast.ai
Code repository for my adventures in the Fast.ai; application of neural networks in Python.

While the links below are also retrievable from the Fast.ai course itself, I'm keeping a list of the ones that I personally have reviewed during the learning process.

Lesson one helpful links:
- Explanation of image kernel: http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/
  - A cool little introduction to what exactly is going on behind the scenes with convolutions; how the filtering process works, and how    different features are extracted from an image.
